    `“We have walked through the darkness of this world, that’s why we are able to see even a sliver of light.” – Gaara`,
    `“We are humans, not fish. We don’t know what kind of people we truly are until the moment before our deaths. As death comes to embrace you, you will realize what you are. That’s what death is, don’t you think?” – Itachi Uchiha`,
    `“Your comrades are there to make up for what you cannot do and to prevent you from ignoring things that you actually might have been able to do.” – Itachi Uchiha`,
    `“It’s because we help out when they’re in trouble that we can count on them to come running when we need it.” – Nara Shikamaru`,
    `“The concept of hope is nothing more than giving up. A word that holds no true meaning.” – Madara Uchiha`,
    `“When you give up, your dreams and everything else, they’re gone.” – Naruto Uzumaki`,
    `“I have long since closed my eyes… My only goal is in the darkness.” – Sasuke Uchiha`,
    `“Darkness. When everything that you know and love is taken away from you so harshly. All you can think about is anger, hatred, and even revenge. And no one can save you.” – Orochimaru`,
    `“People’s lives don’t end when they die. It ends when they lose faith.” – Itachi Uchiha`,
    `“Knowledge and awareness are vague, and perhaps better called illusions. Everyone lives within their own subjective interpretation.” – Itachi Uchiha`,
    `“If you don’t like your destiny, don’t accept it. Instead have the courage to change it the way you want it to be.” – Naruto Uzumaki`,
    `“My name is Sasuke Uchiha. I hate a lot of things, and I don’t particularly like anything. What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. I’m going to restore my clan, and kill a certain someone.” – Sasuke Uchiha`,
    `“You’re wrong, that’s not what makes a shinobi. You never did get it, a real ninja is one who endures no matter what gets thrown at him… Let me explain something to you, there is only one thing that matters if you are a shinobi, and it isn’t the number of Jutsu you possess. All you do need is the guts to never give up.” – Jiraiya`,
    `“I’ll admit that you’re stronger than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what’s truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It’s because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you’ll eventually become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn’t mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends!” – Itachi Uchiha`,
    `“You can steal the very last bite of my very best food. You can mock me all you want. But if you insult my best friend, I will obliterate you.” – Choji Akamichi`,

    `“The pain of being alone is completely out of this world, isn’t it? I don’t know why, but I understand your feelings so much, it actually hurts.” – Naruto Uzumaki`,
    `“Hard work is worthless for those that don’t believe in themselves.” – Naruto Uzumaki`,
    `“Somewhere inside of me? Take a good look, there’s nothing inside of me anymore! I don’t feel pain, I don’t feel anything! You need to let that guilt go Kakashi. This wind hole wasn’t your doing… It was made by this evil, cruel world.” – Obito Uchiha`,
    `“I used to always cry and give up… I made many wrong turns… But you… You helped me find the right path… I always chased after you… I wanted to catch up to you… I wanted to walk beside you all the time… I just wanted to be with you… You changed me! Your smile is what saved me! That is why I’m not afraid to die protecting you! Because… I love you.” – Hinata Hyuga`,
    `“When people are protecting something truly special to them, they truly can become… as strong as they can be.” – Naruto Uzumaki`,

    `“In society, those who don’t have many abilities, tend to complain more.” – Hatake Kakashi`,
    `“People are stupid. If I don’t do this, there will be no peace. Eventually, time will pass and the pain will heal. Eventually, checkmate’s power will weaken and people will begin fighting again. This time, they will use the weapon themselves and once more know true pain. And for the short time, peace will come again. It will give birth to short period of peace within this endless chain of hatred. That’s my wish.” – Pain`,

    `“Even if it’s been a while, you should remember your comrades faces. Why? Because otherwise, you will hurt their feelings when they call out to you.” – Shino Aburame`,
    `“It’s human nature not to realize the true value of something, unless they lose it.” – Orochimaru`,
    `“If love is just a word, then why does it hurt so much if you realize it isn’t there?” – Gaara`,
    `“Even I can tell that hatred is spreading. I wanted to do something about it…but I don’t know what. I believe… that someday the day will come when people truly understand one another!” – Jiraiya`,
    `“War brings death. And wounds and pain to both sides. There’s nothing harder to accept, than the deaths of those you love. So you believe they could never die. Especially those who haven’t known war.” – Nagato`,
    `“Love is not necessary, power is the only true necessity.” – Madara Uchiha`,
    `“I could say I’m not sad, but I’d be lying. The problem is the world won’t let me stay a kid forever, so I can’t lie around crying about it either.” – Nara Shikamaru`,
    `“Now there’s something I understand a little better. Hate, sadness, even joy. To be able to share it with another person… Naruto Uzumaki. From fighting him I learned that. He knew pain like I did and then he taught me that you can change your path. I wish that one day I can be needed by someone. Not as a frightening weapon… But as the sand’s Kazekage.” – Gaara`,
    `“The people of this clan are all the same. You focus on the trivial and lose sight of what’s most important. Change is impossible, in this fog of ignorance. How can we evolve when regulation is all we know?” – Itachi Uchiha`,
    `“You and I are flesh and blood. I’m always going to be there for you, even if it’s only as an obstacle for you to overcome. Even if you do hate me. That’s what big brothers are for.” – Itachi Uchiha`,
    `“I don’t know which is more pathetic; the fool, or those who follow him.” – Jiroubou`,
    `“Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this world. The longer you live, the more you realize that in this reality only pain, suffering and futility exist.” – Madara Uchiha`,
    `“A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home.” – Jiraiya`,
    `“The hole in one’s heart gets filled by others around you. Friends won’t flock to someone who abandons the memory of his friends and gives up on the world just because things don’t go the way he wants them to. That won’t help fill the hole in your heart. And people won’t help those who run away and do nothing. As long as you don’t give up, there will always be salvation.” – Hatake Kakashi`,
    `“In this world, wherever there is light – there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars and hatred is born to protect love.” – Madara Uchiha`,
    `“People cannot win against their loneliness.” – Gaara`,

    `“You have the same eyes as I do…the eyes, filled with hatred and death, that long for strength… Just like mine. Your eyes tell me how badly you wish to kill the one who put you through the hell called loneliness.” – Gaara`,
    `“Fear. That is what we live with. And we live it every day. Only in death are we free of it.” – Neji Gyuga`,
    `“When people get hurt, they learn to hate… When people hurt others, they become hated and racked with guilt. But knowing that pain allows people to be kind. Pain allows people to grow… and how you grow is up to you.” – Jiraiya`,
